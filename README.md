# Foundations for Data Science-Mathematics (Module 1)

These are the course materials for the analytics module 1. Module 1 will cover  basic algebra, SQL Basics,  Probability I, and intro to r. Over the course of the next few weeks, I will create a github repo for module 2. Module 2 will cover Intro to Statistics, Intro to Python, and Matrix Algebra. 

This github repo will contain all the materials for the Analytics Training Sessions pertaining to module 1. Please take some time to get familir with the layout of this repo. You will need to create your own personal github repo. Github will be ideal for sharing work and keeping sessions organized. We want to keep our workflow as self contained as possible. (Independent of sending attached documents) You will need to use your own personal email to make your own github account. Directions are included in the getting started section.


## Getting Started 
Please set up your personal github account and follow the instructions here: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
You will be uploading your Homework Results to your personal github and sharing the link to your guthub repo with the instructor. 

* Please install Anaconda on your personal machines. Anaconda is a distributed system that includes an IDE to write r and python coding. Instructions here: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

* Please install a text editor. I personally like sublime text editor because it color codes the syntax according to detected language. Text editors allow you to write and format code
sublime: https://www.sublimetext.com/
EM-Editor: https://www.emeditor.com/

* Complete diagnostics self tests without looking up answers or methods. This is simply to see where your current knowledge is. 

* SQL Self Diagnostic: https://github.com/vindication09/Data-Science-Mathematics/blob/master/Prerequisites/sql-self-test-2015-business-intelligence.pdf

* Math Self Diagnostic: https://github.com/vindication09/Data-Science-Mathematics/blob/master/Prerequisites/Mathematics_Test_samples.pdf

* Complete the DIY SQL tutorial if you are unable to answer questions on the self diagnostic SQL test: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/

* Additional Lectures on SQL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXV3zeQKqGY

* Once SQL tutorials have been complete, please become familiar with Google Big Query. There will be a more formal training but its good to become familiar early on. https://medium.com/google-cloud/getting-started-with-google-cloud-a-codelab-for-geohackweek-2017-848c25ed72fd

If you are unable to complete math questions on the self diagnostic math test, you will stat with the Algebra lesson I have prepared. 

## Materials

* For Algebra, we will be using Pauls Online Math notes. These open source notes are a popular choice among undergraduates as complimentary material. http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/

* For Probability, we will be using A First Course in Probability by Sheldon Ross. I will include a download link. If you are unable to download the book from this link, I will share the PDF via google drive. https://readyforai.com/download/a-first-course-in-probability-9th-edition-pdf/

* Intro to R https://github.com/vindication09/Data-Science-Mathematics/blob/master/R-intro.pdf

* I will share the links to the github repos where SQL materials are stored. You can download the materials from each link. I highly encourage you to get "The Language of SQL" by Larry Rockoff 

## Live Sessions
Lessons for Live Sessions will be published online via rpubs. You can access them anytime using your web browser. Links to HW problems are posted at the end of each lesson. This section will continue to update as more lessons come out. Please check this section often for updates. Please see the lessons below:
